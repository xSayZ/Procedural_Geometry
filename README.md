# Procedural Object Generation in Unity
This Unity project demonstrates the generation of procedural objects with complex geometry. The goal of this project is to showcase a robust system for creating unique and visually appealing objects using procedural techniques.

## Features
- **Procedurally generated pre-built tiles:** The project utilizes procedural algorithms to generate pre-built tiles with diverse layouts, patterns, and designs. Each tile is dynamically created, offering a wide range of possibilities for creating unique and immersive environments.
- **Customizable parameters:** Users can adjust various parameters, such as tile size, complexity, theme, and connectivity, to control the generated tile's characteristics. This flexibility allows for tailored tile generation to fit specific game levels or visual styles.
- **Seamless tile integration:** The generated tiles seamlessly connect to form larger environments. The procedural generation algorithm ensures that the tiles fit together smoothly, eliminating visible seams or inconsistencies between neighboring tiles.
- **Real-time preview and iteration:** Users can visualize the generated tiles in real-time, enabling rapid iteration and experimentation. Instant feedback allows for quick adjustments to parameters, resulting in efficient and effective tile creation.
- **Dynamic tile variations:** In addition to generating static pre-built tiles, the system can also produce dynamic variations. These variations introduce diversity within a single tile design, providing a sense of randomness and unpredictability to the generated environments.


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/procedural-object-generation.git```

1. Open the cloned project in Unity.
2. Explore the project's folder structure to familiarize yourself with the different components and assets used.
3. Open the main scene of the project, MainScene.unity, to start experimenting with the procedural object generation system.
4. Adjust the various parameters exposed in the inspector to modify the object's appearance.
5. Press the play button in Unity to preview the generated object in real-time.
6. Once satisfied with the generated object, you can export it to your preferred format by following the export instructions provided in the project.
